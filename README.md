# 57 exercises

I am [Charlie Harvey](http://charlieharvey.org.uk) and these are my solutions to the exercises in [57 Exercises for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers), written in the [Haskell](http://haskell.org) programming language.

My intention is to solve each of the exercises and write at least a trivial test for any non-trivial pure function in the code. Sometimes this results in slightly unnecessary tests.

### Running tests

From top directory do:
$ stack test 

You can say 
$ stack test --test-arguments -a1000

The -a100 tells Spec to generate 1000 quickcheck cases for each case

### Compiling

It doesn&#8217;t compile because I have been working exclusively in GHCI. I shall sort out the cabal file eventually. Maybe.

### Deadline?

Nah. Just working on these on train journeys and lunch breaks!
